# Developing

If you already cloned the repository and you know that you need to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.

## Virtual environment with `venv`

You can create a virtual environment in a directory using Python's `venv` module:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

That will create a directory `./venv/` with the Python binaries and then you will be able to install packages for that isolated environment.

## Activate the environment

Activate the new environment with:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure you have the latest pip version on your virtual environment to

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## pip

After activating the environment as described above:

```bash
pip install -e ."[dev]"
```

It will install all the dependencies and your local FastDepends in your local environment.

### Using your local FastDepends

If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastDepends, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your local FastDepends source code.

And if you update that local FastDepends source code, as it is installed with `-e`, when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastDepends you just edited.

That way, you don't have to "install" your local version to be able to test every change.

## Tests

### Pytests

To run tests with your current FastDepends application and Python environment use:

```bash
pytest tests
# or
bash ./scripts/test.sh
# with coverage output
bash ./scripts/test-cov.sh
```
