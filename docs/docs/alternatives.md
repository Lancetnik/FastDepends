# Some more featured DI python libraries

`FastDepend` is a very small toolkit to achieve one point: provide you opportunity
to use **FastAPI** `Depends` and typecasting everywhere.

Sometimes, more complex tools are required. In these cases I can reccomend you to take a look at
the following projects

## [DI](https://adriangb.com/di/)

`di` is a modern dependency injection toolkit, modeled around the simplicity of FastAPI's
dependency injection.

Key features:

* Intuitive: simple API, inspired by FastAPI
* Auto-wiring: `di` also supports auto-wiring using type annotations
* Scopes: inspired by `pytest scopes`, but defined by users
* Composable: decoupled internal APIs give you the flixibility to customize wiring, execution and binding.
* Performant: `di` can execute dependencies in parallel and cache results ins scopes.

## [Dependency Injector](https://python-dependency-injector.etc-labs.org)

Dependency Injector is a dependency injection framework for Python.

It helps implementing the dependency injection principle.

Key features:

* Providers
* Overriding on the fly
* Configuration (yaml, ini, json, pydantic, .env, etc)
* Resources
* Containers
* Wiring
* Asynchronous
* Typing
* Perfomance
* Maturity
